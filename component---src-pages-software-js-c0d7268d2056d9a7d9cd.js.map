These bindings\n          enable scientists to develop image analysis workflows in their\n          preferred programming language. The software supports more than 15\n          different image file formats, provides over 280 image analysis\n          filters, and implements a unified interface to the ITK intensity-based\n          registration framework.\n        </p>\n\n        <p> SimpleITK was created as part of a concerted effort to simplify the\n        use of the Insight Toolkit, making it more accessible to a wider\n        audience.
