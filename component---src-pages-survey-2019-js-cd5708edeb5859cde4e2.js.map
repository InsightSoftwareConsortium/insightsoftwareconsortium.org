In addition to providing a\n          robust infrastructure for the dissemination of complex algorithms\n          across different fields, ITK has organically created a vibrant and\n          active community in scientific image analysis.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In an attempt to objectively measure the impact of this open-source\n          tool and the number of its active users, last year we launched a\n          community survey to hear first hand about the ITK community. We\n          received a total of 82 responses. Below we summarize a few of the\n          findings.\n        </p>\n        <h3 id=\"About-the-ITK-Users\">About the ITK Users</h3>\n        <p>\n          The majority of users of ITK work in academic research (66%) followed\n          closely by those working in commercial software development (32%). The\n          overwhelming majority of ITK users work in the field of medical\n          imaging (74.4%). We find ITK is also used in other fields such as\n          biological imaging (12%), material science (3.7%) or biomechanics\n          (1.2%).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Our survey revealed the fact ITK’s C++ programming interface is most\n          often used, followed closely by ITK Python programming interface.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <img src={interfaces} alt=\"ITK programming interfaces\" />\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          When asked about how ITK is used, we obtained responses in three main\n          categories: a) Direct use, b) use as part of derived products that\n          heavily rely in ITK such as{' '}\n          <MuiLink\n            href=\"http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            ANTS\n          </MuiLink>\n          ,{' '}\n          <MuiLink\n            href=\"http://openrtk.org/\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            RTK\n          </MuiLink>\n          ,{' '}\n          <MuiLink\n            href=\"https://www.slicer.org/\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            3D Slicer\n          </MuiLink>{' '}\n          or{' '}\n          <MuiLink\n            href=\"https://www.mevislab.de/\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            MeVisLab\n          </MuiLink>{' '}\n          and c) as a resource in their own image analysis codebases, examples\n          of this are{' '}\n          <MuiLink\n            href=\"https://github.com/spinicist/QUIT\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            QUIT\n          </MuiLink>\n          ,{' '}\n          <MuiLink\n            href=\"https://github.com/qMRLab/qMRLab\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            qMRLab\n          </MuiLink>\n          , or Allen Institute’s{' '}\n          <MuiLink\n            href=\"https://github.com/AllenInstitute/aics-segmentation\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            aics-segmentation\n          </MuiLink>\n          .

Also\n          improve the quantity of tutorials on how to perform basic image\n          operations with ITK classes, e.g. webinars and video tutorials or\n          improve and update the ITK Guide.
