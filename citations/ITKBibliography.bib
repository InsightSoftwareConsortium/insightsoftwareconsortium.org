  abstract  = {The Insight Toolkit (ITK) is an open-source software toolkit for performing registration and segmentation. Segmentation is the process of identifying and classifying data found in a digitally sampled representation. Typically the sampled representation is an image acquired from such medical instrumentation as CT or MRI scanners. Registration is the task of aligning or developing correspondences between data. For example, in the medical environment, a CT scan may be aligned with a MRI scan in order to combine the information contained in both. ITK is a cross-platform software. It uses a build environment known as CMake to manage platform-specific project generation and compilation process in a platform-independent way. ITK is implemented in C++. ITK's implementation style employs generic programming, which involves the use of templates to generate, at compile-time, code that can be applied generically to any class or data-type that supports the operations used by the template. The use of C++ templating means that the code is highly efficient and many issues are discovered at compile- time, rather than at run-time during program execution. It also means that many of ITK's algorithms can be applied to arbitrary spatial dimensions and pixel types. An automated wrapping system integrated with ITK generates an interface between C++ and a high-level programming language Python. This enables rapid prototyping and faster exploration of ideas by shortening the edit-compile-execute cycle. In addition to automated wrapping, the SimpleITK project provides a streamlined interface to ITK that is available for C++, Python, Java, CSharp, R, Tcl and Ruby. Developers from around the world can use, debug, maintain, and extend the software because ITK is an open-source project. ITK uses a model of software development known as Extreme Programming. Extreme Programming collapses the usual software development methodology into a simultaneous iterative process of design-implement-test-release. The key features of Extreme Programming are communication and testing. Communication among the members of the ITK community is what helps manage the rapid evolution of the software. Testing is what keeps the software stable. An extensive testing process supported by the system known as CDash measures the quality of ITK code on a daily basis. The ITK Testing Dashboard is updated continuously, reflecting the quality of the code at any moment. The most recent version of this document is available online at http://itk.org/ItkSoftwareGuide.pdf. This book is a guide to developing soft- ware with ITK; it is the first of two companion books. This book covers building and installation, general architecture and design, as well as the process of contributing in the ITK community. The second book covers detailed design and functionality for reading and and writing images, filtering, registration, segmentation, and performing statistical analysis.},

The use of C++ templating means that the code is highly efficient and many issues are discovered at compile-time, rather than at run-time during program execution. It also means that many of ITK's al gorithms can be applied to arbitrary spatial dimensions and pixel types. An automated wrapping system integrated with ITK generates an interface between C++ and a high- level programming language Python . This enables rapid prototyping and faster exploration of i deas by shortening the edit-compile-execute cycle. In addition to automated wrapping, the SimpleITK project provides a streamlined interface to ITK that is avai lable for C++, Python, Java, CSharp, R, Tcl and Ruby. Developers from around the world can use, debug, maintain, a nd extend the software because ITK is an open-source project. ITK uses a model of software devel opment known as Extreme Program- ming. Extreme Programming collapses the usual software dev elopment methodology into a simulta- neous iterative process of design-implement-test-releas e. The key features of Extreme Programming are communication and testing. Communication among the mem bers of the ITK community is what helps manage the rapid evolution of the software. Testing is what keeps the software stable. An extensive testing process supported by the system known as CDash measures the quality of ITK code on a daily basis. The ITK Testing Dashboard is updated co ntinuously, reflecting the quality of the code at any moment. The most recent version of this document is available online at http://itk.org/ItkSoftwareGuide.pdf . This book is a guide to developing software with ITK; it is the first of two companion books. This book cove rs building and installation, general architecture and design, as well as the process of contribut ing in the ITK community. The second book covers detailed design and functionality for reading a nd writing images, filtering, registration, segmentation, and performing statistical analysis.},

abstract = {Publicly available scientific resources help establish evaluation standards, provide a platform for teaching and may improve reproducibility. Version 4 of the Insight ToolKit ( ITK 4 ) seeks to establish new standards in publicly available image registration methodology. In this work, we provide an overview and preliminary evaluation of the revised toolkit against registration based on the previous major ITK version (3.20). Furthermore, we propose a nomenclature that may be used to discuss registration frameworks via schematic representations. In total, the ITK 4 contribution is intended as a structure to support reproducible research practices, will provide a more extensive foundation against which to evaluate new work in image registration and also enable application level programmers a broad suite of tools on which to build.},

  abstract  = {The creation of high-quality medical imaging reference atlas datasets with consistent dense anatomical region labels is a challenging task. Reference atlases have many uses in medical image applications and are essential components of atlas-based segmentation tools commonly used for producing personalized anatomical measurements for individual subjects. The process of manual identification of anatomical regions by experts is regarded as a so-called gold standard; however, it is usually impractical because of the labor-intensive costs. Further, as the number of regions of interest increases, these manually created atlases often contain many small inconsistently labeled or disconnected regions that need to be identified and corrected. This project proposes an efficient process to drastically reduce the time necessary for manual revision in order to improve atlas label quality. We introduce the LabelAtlasEditor tool, a SimpleITK-based open-source label atlas correction tool distributed within the image visualization software 3D Slicer. LabelAtlasEditor incorporates several 3D Slicer widgets into one consistent interface and provides label-specific correction tools, allowing for rapid identification, navigation, and modification of the small, disconnected erroneous labels within an atlas. The technical details for the implementation and performance of LabelAtlasEditor are demonstrated using an application of improving a set of 20 Huntingtons Disease-specific multi-modal brain atlases. Additionally, we present the advantages and limitations of automatic atlas correction. After the correction of atlas inconsistencies and small, disconnected regions, the number of unidentified voxels for each dataset was reduced on average by 68.48{\%}.},

  abstract  = {Machine learning (ML)-based segmentation methods are a common technique in the medical image processing field. In spite of numerous research groups that have investigated ML-based segmentation frameworks, there remains unanswered aspects of performance variability for the choice of two key components: ML algorithm and intensity normalization. This investigation reveals that the choice of those elements plays a major part in determining segmentation accuracy and generalizability. The approach we have used in this study aims to evaluate relative benefits of the two elements within a subcortical MRI segmentation framework. Experiments were conducted to contrast eight machine-learning algorithm configurations and 11 normalization strategies for our brain MR segmentation framework. For the intensity normalization, a Stable Atlas-based Mapped Prior (STAMP) was utilized to take better account of contrast along boundaries of structures. Comparing eight machine learning algorithms on down-sampled segmentation MR data, it was obvious that a significant improvement was obtained using ensemble-based ML algorithms (i.e., random forest) or ANN algorithms. Further investigation between these two algorithms also revealed that the random forest results provided exceptionally good agreement with manual delineations by experts. Additional experiments showed that the effect of STAMP-based intensity normalization also improved the robustness of segmentation for multicenter data sets. The constructed framework obtained good multicenter reliability and was successfully applied on a large multicenter MR data set (n{\textgreater}. 3000). Less than 10{\%} of automated segmentations were recommended for minimal expert intervention. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using the ML-based segmentation tools for processing large amount of multicenter MR images. We demonstrated dramatically different result profiles in segmentation accuracy according to the choice of ML algorithm and intensity normalization chosen. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects striatal neurons. Striatal volume loss is present years before clinical diagnosis; however, white matter degradation may also occur prior to diagnosis. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can measure microstructural changes associated with degeneration that precede macrostructural changes. DWI derived measures enhance understanding of degeneration in prodromal HD (pre-HD). METHODS As part of the PREDICT-HD study, N = 191 pre-HD individuals and 70 healthy controls underwent two or more (baseline and 1-5 year follow-up) DWI, with n = 649 total sessions. Images were processed using cutting-edge DWI analysis methods for large multicenter studies. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics were computed in selected tracts connecting the primary motor, primary somato-sensory, and premotor areas of the cortex with the subcortical caudate and putamen. Pre-HD participants were divided into three CAG-Age Product (CAP) score groups reflecting clinical diagnosis probability (low, medium, or high probabilities). Baseline and longitudinal group differences were examined using linear mixed models. RESULTS Cross-sectional and longitudinal differences in DTI measures were present in all three CAP groups compared with controls. The high CAP group was most affected. CONCLUSIONS This is the largest longitudinal DWI study of pre-HD to date. Findings showed DTI differences, consistent with white matter degeneration, were present up to a decade before predicted HD diagnosis. Our findings indicate a unique role for disrupted connectivity between the premotor area and the putamen, which may be closely tied to the onset of motor symptoms in HD.

  abstract  = {The BRAINS (Brain Research: Analysis of Images, Networks, and Systems) image analysis software has been in use, and in constant development, for over 20. years. The original neuroimage analysis pipeline using BRAINS was designed as a semiautomated procedure to measure volumes of the cerebral lobes and subcortical structures, requiring manual intervention at several stages in the process. Through use of advanced image processing algorithms the need for manual intervention at stages of image realignment, tissue sampling, and mask editing have been eliminated. In addition, inhomogeneity correction, intensity normalization, and mask cleaning routines have been added to improve the accuracy and consistency of the results. The fully automated method, AutoWorkup, is shown in this study to be more reliable (ICC ≥ 0.96, Jaccard index ≥ 0.80, and Dice index ≥ 0.89 for all tissues in all regions) than the average of 18 manual raters. On a set of 1130 good quality scans, the failure rate for correct realignment was 1.1{\%}, and manual editing of the brain mask was required on 4{\%} of the scans. In other tests, AutoWorkup is shown to produce measures that are reliable for data acquired across scanners, scanner vendors, and across sequences. Application of AutoWorkup for the analysis of data from the 32-site, multivendor PREDICT-HD study yield estimates of reliability to be greater than or equal to 0.90 for all tissues and regions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Lung segmentation is a critical initial step in planning radiation therapy interventions for lung cancer patients. Achieving robust automatic segmentation of lungs with large tumors is challenging due to large variations in lung morphology, tumor location, and tumor shape between subjects. We present an automatic method to segment lungs with large tumors in CT images using an initial intensity based segmentation followed by alpha shape construction and graph search. We evaluated our method by comparing automated segmentations to manual segmentations on twelve subjects. Computed metrics for segmentation quality include average surface distance of 0.727 mm and average DICE coefficient of 0.970. These results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately segments the entire lung regions both free of and in the presence of large tumors.},

  abstract     = {A common procedure performed by many groups in the analysis of neuroimaging data is separating the brain from other tissues. This procedure is often utilized both by volumetric studies as well as functional imaging studies. Regardless of the intent, an accurate, robust method of identifying the brain or cranial vault is imperative. While this is a common requirement, there are relatively few tools to perform this task. Most of these tools require a T1 weighted image and are therefore not able to accurately define a region that includes surface CSF. In this paper, we have developed a novel brain extraction technique termed Maximize Uniformity by Summation Heuristic (MUSH) optimization. The algorithm was designed for extraction of the brain and surface CSF from a multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging study. The method forms a linear combination of multi-modal MR imaging data to make the signal intensity within the brain as uniform as possible. The resulting image is thresholded and simple morphological operators are utilized to generate the resulting representation of the brain. The resulting method was applied to a sample of 20 MR brain scans and compared to the results generated by 3dSkullStrip, 3dIntracranial, BET, and BET2. The average Jaccard metrics for the twenty subjects was 0.66 (BET), 0.61 (BET2), 0.88 (3dIntracranial), 0.91 (3dSkullStrip), and 0.94 (MUSH).},

  abstract  = {In the last decade, diffusion MRI (dMRI) studies of the human and animal brain have been used to investigate a multitude of pathologies and drug-related effects in neuroscience research. Study after study identifies white matter (WM) degeneration as a crucial biomarker for all these diseases. The tool of choice for studying WM is dMRI. However, dMRI has inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and its acquisition requires a relatively long scan time; in fact, the high loads required occasionally stress scanner hardware past the point of physical failure. As a result, many types of artifacts implicate the quality of diffusion imagery. Using these complex scans containing artifacts without quality control (QC) can result in considerable error and bias in the subsequent analysis, negatively affecting the results of research studies using them. However, dMRI QC remains an under-recognized issue in the dMRI community as there are no user-friendly tools commonly available to comprehensively address the issue of dMRI QC. As a result, current dMRI studies often perform a poor job at dMRI QC. Thorough QC of dMRI will reduce measurement noise and improve reproducibility, and sensitivity in neuroimaging studies; this will allow researchers to more fully exploit the power of the dMRI technique and will ultimately advance neuroscience. Therefore, in this manuscript, we present our open-source software, DTIPrep, as a unified, user friendly platform for thorough QC of dMRI data. These include artifacts caused by eddy-currents, head motion, bed vibration and pulsation, venetian blind artifacts, as well as slice-wise and gradient-wise intensity inconsistencies. This paper summarizes a basic set of features of DTIPrep described earlier and focuses on newly added capabilities related to directional artifacts and bias analysis.},

  abstract  = {{\textcopyright} 2016 SPIE.This work reports on a comparative study between five manual and automated methods for intra-subject pair-wise registration of images from different modalities. The study includes a variety of inter-modal image registrations (MR-CT, PET-CT, PET-MR) utilizing different methods including two manual point-based techniques using rigid and similarity transformations, one automated point-based approach based on Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, and two automated intensity-based methods using mutual information (MI) and normalized mutual information (NMI). These techniques were employed for inter-modal registration of brain images of 9 subjects from a publicly available dataset, and the results were evaluated qualitatively via checkerboard images and quantitatively using root mean square error and MI criteria. In addition, for each inter-modal registration, a paired t-test was performed on the quantitative results in order to find any significant difference between the results of the studied registration techniques.},

  abstract  = {A robust fully automated algorithm for identifying an arbitrary number of landmark points in the human brain is described and validated. The proposed method combines statistical shape models with trained brain morphometric measures to estimate midbrain landmark positions reliably and accurately. Gross morphometric constraints provided by automatically identified eye centers and the center of the head mass are shown to provide robust initialization in the presence of large rotations in the initial head orientation. Detection of primary midbrain landmarks are used as the foundation from which extended detection of an arbitrary set of secondary landmarks in different brain regions by applying a linear model estimation and principle component analysis. This estimation model sequentially uses the knowledge of each additional detected landmark as an improved foundation for improved prediction of the next landmark location. The accuracy and robustness of the presented method was evaluated by comparing the automatically generated results to two manual raters on 30 identified landmark points extracted from each of 30 T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. For the landmarks with unambiguous anatomical definitions, the average discrepancy between the algorithm results and each human observer differed by less than 1 mm from the average inter-observer variability when the algorithm was evaluated on imaging data collected from the same site as the model building data. Similar results were obtained when the same model was applied to a set of heterogeneous image volumes from seven different collection sites representing 3 scanner manufacturers. This method is reliable for general application in large-scale multi-site studies that consist of a variety of imaging data with different orientations, spacings, origins, and field strengths.},
