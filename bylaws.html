<p><strong>Consortium- The Insight Software Consortium (ISC)</strong></p>

<p>ITK - The software system known as the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit originally developed under contract from the US National Library of Medicine, and further extended by its community of users and developers. ITK consists of source code, data, tests, examples and documentation.</p>

<p>Open-Source Software – Software that is freely available in source code form. The source code may be accessed, modified, and distributed by any person or organization, commercial or non-commercial.</p>

<p>Open Science – The practice of making available all material, software, data, and publications used in scientific research, design, and engineering with the intention of supporting the reuse and reproducibility of research, and to insure that the results of scientific research can be used for educational and commercial purposes.</p>

<p>PIs - (Principal Investigators) These are the six individuals who managed the development of ITK and were present at the completion of the project in September 2003: Stephen Aylward, Bill Lorensen, Dimitris Metaxas, Lydia Ng, Will Schroeder, and Ross Whitaker.</p>

<p><strong>  BOARD OF DIRECTORS</strong></p>
  
<p>  The original Board of Directors consists of the six PI's, Jim Miller, Johua Cates, and Luis Ibanez. </p>
  
<p>  Section 3.1 Power of Board.</p>
  
<p>  The affairs of the Consortium shall be managed by the Board of Directors. Decisions will be made by majority vote of the Board.</p>
  
<p>  Section 3.2 Number of Directors.</p>
  
<p>  The number of Directors of the Consortium shall consist of no less than four individuals but nor more than fourteen as designated by the Board.</p>

<p>  A Director shall serve on the board for a two-year period at which point the Board may grant an additional term. Directors may serve multiple terms without limit.</p>
  
<p>  Section 3.4. Annual Meeting.</p>
  
<p>  One meeting each year of the Board of Directors shall be designated as the Annual Meeting. Notice of this meeting will be given to all Members of the Consortium. The notice shall include the time, date, and location of the meeting. This notice shall be mailed at least 15 days before the time set for the Annual Meeting. (Other meetings of the Board shall be determined by the Board as a whole or on written request by at least three Board members. Such requests shall be directed to the President of the Consortium.) All meetings of the Board of Directors shall be deemed open to all membership categories, but only members of the Board shall be allowed to vote. Roberts Rules of Order shall be used in the conduct of all meetings.</p>
  
<p>  Section 3.5. Quorum for a Meeting.</p>
  
<p>  A quorum shall consist of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors.</p>
  
<p>  In the absence of a quorum at any meeting of the Board of Directors, a majority of the Directors present may adjourn the meeting. A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough Directors to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for such meeting.</p>
  
<p>  Section 3.6. Notice.</p>
  
<p>  Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of these Bylaws, it may be given by written notice delivered personally or sent by mail, express delivery service, electronic facsimile transmission, or email to each Member at his or her address as shown by the records of the Consortium. If mailed or sent by express delivery service, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered three (3) days after being deposited in the United States mail or express delivery service in a sealed package so addressed, with delivery charges thereon prepaid.

<p>  Section 3.7. Waiver of Notice.</p>
  
<p>  Any Member may waive notice of any meeting, either before or after the time notice would have been required. A Director's attendance at any meeting shall constitute waiver of notice of such meeting, excepting such attendance at a meeting by the Director for the purpose of objecting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Except as specifically required by the Articles, or special or by the Bylaws, nether the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of any regular meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice, or waiver of notice, of such meeting.</p>
  
<p>  Section 3.8. Informal Action by Directors: Meetings by Conference Telephone.</p>
  
<p>  Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Board may be taken without a meeting – with consent in writing setting forth the action to be taken and signed by the majority of Directors authorizing the action. Such consent shall have the same force and effect as a majority vote. The signed documents setting forth such consent by all directors shall be filed with the minutes of the Proceedings of the Board. Any or all Directors may participate in a meeting of the Board or a committee of the Board by means of a conference telephone or video conference system, or by any means of communications by which all persons participating are able to see and/or hear one another, and such participation shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.</p>
  
<p>  Section 3.. Compensation of the Directors.</p>
  
<p>  The Consortium shall not pay any compensation to Directors for services rendered to the Consortium, except that directors may be reimbursed for expenses incurred in the performance of their duties to the Consortium.
